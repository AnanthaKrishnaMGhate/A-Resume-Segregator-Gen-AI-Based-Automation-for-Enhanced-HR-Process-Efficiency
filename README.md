# A Resume Segregator Gen AI Based Automation for Enhanced HR Process Efficiency
## Project Overview
This project implements an **AI-driven HR automation system** designed to streamline and optimize the resume screening and candidate evaluation process. The system automates the analysis of resumes, extracts relevant candidate information, evaluates profiles using predefined criteria, and assists HR teams in identifying suitable candidates efficiently.

The solution focuses on reducing manual effort, improving screening accuracy, and enabling scalable recruitment workflows through the use of **Generative AI and automation techniques**.

## Problem Statement
Traditional resume screening is time-consuming, manual, and prone to inconsistencies. HR teams often need to process a large volume of resumes, making it difficult to ensure fair and efficient evaluation. This project addresses these challenges by providing an automated system capable of analyzing resumes and supporting data-driven hiring decisions.

## System Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture consisting of:
- Resume ingestion and preprocessing
- AI-based resume analysis and scoring
- Candidate classification and storage
- Optional communication and reporting modules

Each module operates independently, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.
