## 📄 A Resume Segregator Gen AI Based Automation for Enhanced HR Process Efficiency
The rapid increase in job applications has made manual resume screening inefficient and inconsistent for Human Resource (HR) departments. Traditional hiring workflows are time-consuming and often subject to human bias. This project, **Resume Segregator**, presents a **Generative AI–based HR automation framework** designed to improve recruitment efficiency and decision quality.

The system leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically **Groq’s LLaMA-3**, to analyze resume content and evaluate candidates based on skills, experience, and relevance to job requirements. Resumes are processed using **Python-based libraries**, including **PyPDF2** for document parsing and **Streamlit** for building an interactive user interface.
